# Portfolio Website Project

- **Project path**: `~/sites/portfolio-website` (or `/Users/williamhunt/sites/portfolio-website`)
- All code changes, new files, and edits for this website must be made **inside this folder**.
- Do not assume or use `~/sites/personal/` for this project; this repo is the single source of truth for the portfolio site.
